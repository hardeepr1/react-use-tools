# 🧰 use-tools — Advanced React Custom Hooks

## What are React Custom Hooks?

React custom hooks are simple functions that use built-in hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic across components. They help you keep your components clean and DRY by extracting common behaviors into reusable functions.

> 🚧 **Work In Progress**: This library is currently under active development.

**use-tools** is a modern, lightweight collection of reusable React custom hooks written in TypeScript. It helps developers add common behaviors like debouncing, throttling, timers, and lifecycle tracking in a clean and performant way.
